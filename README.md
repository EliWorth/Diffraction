# A Quick Introduction to the Diffraction Library
The diffraction library is a collection of MATLAB scripts for modeling of various diffraction geometries for diffraction of x-rays or electrons from crystals. The library was developed with the Ultrafast Science community in mind. This Quick Intro is targeted towards experienced MATLAB users who wish to quickly learn the key functionalities of the library. It is not intended as an expansive documentation of the library. The examples below use graphite as the template crystal to showcase the capabilities of the library.

## Build lattice structure


## Define probe


## Generate powder diffraction pattern/data


## Simulate non-coplanar diffraction from crystals with preferred orientation


## Calculate exit angles for non-coplanar diffraction from single-crystals


## Simulate diffraction pattern in Transmisison Electron Microscopy



To be deleted (below):

- Calculating basic properties of crystals such as planar distances, scattering vectors, geometrical structure factors, etc.

- Modeling of various diffraction geometries such as coplanar symmetric diffraction, coplanar asymmetric diffraction, and non-coplanar diffraction.

- Simulating geometrical diffraction patterns such as the one shown below for grazing incidence x-ray diffraction off a graphite crystal.
